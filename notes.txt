abstract word is used in a class when we dont implement that method in class
public abstract void drive();
 - for abstract method, class must also be abstract class ex:- abstract class car{ }
 - we cannot we object for abstract class , but can create reference to abstract class
   but can create object for its child class.
 - the abstract method in a abstract class must be defined in child class
 - There is no compulsory that abstract method should have abstarct class,
   it may have normal methods also
